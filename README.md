# droneMapping
Interactive maps (orthomosaics) and surface models made from pictures collected by a drone (Parrot Anafi)
These pictures were collected using the [Pix4Dcapture App](https://www.pix4d.com/product/pix4dcapture) and were processed using [WebODM](https://www.opendronemap.org/webodm/), an open-source software package that can build maps, surface models, and 3-D models from drone images.
